The most common causes of tooth decay are endodontic treatment's extensive tooth structure loss and coronal and radicular dentin drying. , Materials and methods , Two hundred removed human permanent mandibular first molars were allowed to be stored in isotonic saline solution for a maximum of 72 hours. The collection, storing, sterilizing, and handling of the samples were done per the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Out of a total of 200 newly removed mandibular first molars, 120 teeth were finally gathered, sterilized, and kept in 1% thymol in normal saline at 30 degrees Celsius. The access cavity was prepared, and the pulp chamber was cleaned and debrided using an ultrasonic scaler tip while being irrigated with regular saline. A digital radiograph was taken after a 6# K file was placed to the working length in the mesiobuccal canal. Based on their weights, the samples were dispersed equally across the six groups (n=20). They looked inside them to ensure that the root morphology was normal and that the canal was open and free of any abnormalities, damage, or fillings. They looked at the curvature of the mesial root and chose samples with a curvature of 20-35 degrees. The mesial roots were dissected, labeled, and put in a different location. , Results , Overall, the experimental group's incidence of buccolingual fractures was 55%, making it the most prevalent fracture type. The mesiodistal type of fracture had a 35% incidence rate, which was the second most prevalent. We found that comminuted and transverse fractures occurred in only 15% and 5% of patients, respectively, of all fractures. Both the test and the control groups had a disproportionately high number of buccolingual fractures. When comparing the root fracture loads of the two experimental groups, there was no significant difference (p>0.05) , Conclusion , Within this study's restrictions and standardization techniques, it can be concluded that the single file system-prepared roots' resistance to fracture was comparable to that of the control group. It is recommended to conduct additional research on these single file systems using different metrics and to assess them in a clinical setting. , Introduction , The major goal of the root canal obturation technique in endodontic therapy is to strengthen the tooth's fracture resistance by reinforcing the root canal space. Researchers have shown that teeth that have had endodontic treatment are more likely to break than their healthy counterparts. All of the tooth's original structure must be well cared for and safeguarded for the restoration to be successful. Bio-mechanical root canal preparation is an essential part of endodontic treatment. As a result, the tooth that has had endodontic treatment becomes more brittle. , The introduction of nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary instruments ushered in new times. The clinical labor time required to navigate even the most steeply curved canals was greatly reduced. Researchers have shown that a tooth's fracture resistance is proportional to the quantity of residual dentin. Researchers have found a link between the construction of nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary instruments and the development of vertical root fractures. The mechanical behavior and geometry of rotary instruments, together with the skill and training of the operator, determine the difficulties encountered during operation. There seems to be a spectrum of root fracture presentations in endodontically treated teeth. Numerous clinical types of research have demonstrated that vertical root fractures are linked to 11%-13% of removed teeth after endodontic therapy. On the canal walls, endodontic operations cause craze lines and fractures that develop into concentrated regions of severe stress. These defects may gradually move to the surface over time and finally form a vertical root. , One of the most severe root canal complications, vertical root fracture, can happen before, during, or after root canal obturation and has a poor prognosis. It most frequently results in the extraction of the \n","\n","3] (2)\t \tNumber of interpreting physicians or surgeons\t\t \t 0\t26.7 (16)\t \t 1–2\t21.7 (13)\t \t 3–4\t10.0 (6)\t \t 5–6\t0.0 (0)\t \t 7–12\t6.7 (4)\t \tNo response\t30.0 (18)\t \tNumber of radiologists\t\t \t 1–2\t58.3 (29)\t \t 3–4\t16.7 (10)\t \t 5–6\t11.7 (7)\t \t 7–13\t16.7 (10)\t \t , Cost and payment methods accepted , Cost and payment methods\t% (N)\t \t\t \tCost of routine mammogram\t\t \t <$100\t47.1 (25)\t \t $100–149\t45.0 (27)\t \t $150–199\t6.7 (4)\t \t $200–249\t3.3 (2)\t \t $250–299\t3.3 (2)\t \tCost of diagnostic mammogram\t\t \t <$100\t33.3 (20)\t \t $100–149\t26.7 (16)\t \t $150–199\t23.3 (14)\t \t $200–249\t6.7 (5)\t \t $250–299\t1.7 (1)\t \t ≥$300\t6.7 (4)\t \tPayment methods accepted\t\t \t Cash/check\t88.3 (53)\t \t Medicare\t85.0 (51)\t \t Medicaid\t78.3 (47)\t \t Non-Profit\t30.0 (18)\t \t Private\t76.7 (46)\t \t HMO\t76.7 (46)\t \t County/state\t28.3 (17)\t \t Other\t13.3 (8)\t \t All listed\t23.3 (14)\t \t---Muscle: a source of progenitor cells for bone fracture healing , Bone repair failure is a major complication of open fracture, leading to non-union of broken bone extremities and movement at the fracture site. This results in a serious disability for patients. The role played by the periosteum and bone marrow progenitors in bone repair is now well documented. In contrast, limited information is available on the role played by myogenic progenitor cells in bone repair. In a recent article published in BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, Liu et al. compared the presence of myogenic progenitor (MyoD lineage cells) in closed and open fractures. They showed that myogenic progenitors are present in open, but not closed fractures, suggesting that muscle satellite cells may colonize the fracture site in the absence of intact periosteum. Interestingly, these progenitors sequentially expressed a chondrogenic and, thereafter, an osteoblastic phenotype, suggestive of a functional role in the repair process. This finding opens up new perspectives for the research of orthopedic surgical methods, which could maximize myogenic progenitor access and mobilization to augment bone repair. , Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/12/288 , Background , There are millions of fractures each year the world over, generated by traumatic injury. According to the force of the impact, fractures are closed with a limited angle of dislocation, or open with a serious displacement of the broken bone extremities inducing severe injuries of the surrounding tissues (muscles, blood vessels, skin, nerves). While immobilization and surgery may facilitate healing, a fracture ultimately heals through physiological processes in 6 to 8 weeks. Bone repair is dependent on the presence of osteocompetent progenitors that are able to differentiate and generate new bone. Progenitors coming from the periosteum and the bone marrow compartment play a pivotal role. However, there are many circumstances that limit the access of these primary osteoprogenitors, for example, damage to the periosteum, debridement to prevent infection and internal fixation. These circumstances occur in high-energy traumatic open fractures, which often leads to 'non-union' (pseudarthrosis or failed fracture) of the broken bone \n","\n","4] number of patients, with the rates in parentheses. , This is the number of patients with another fragility fracture diagnosis code at a different anatomic location from the index fracture on a claim within 2 years of the index fracture. , Total Primary Fragility Fractures by Anatomic Location , Primary Fracture Location\tNo. of Fractures* (N = 36,295)\t \tSpine\t14,209 (39%)\t \tHip\t9,370 (26%)\t \tWrist\t4,897 (13%)\t \tHumerus\t4,277 (12%)\t \tPelvis\t2,943 (8%)\t \tOther pathologic fracture\t599 (2%)\t \t , The values are given as the number of fractures, with the percentage in parentheses.

Fractures passing through the pedicles were added to the classification, but interpedicular separation and bone fragments with the excess pediculolaminar junction (corner) (PLC) in the spinal canal were not included in the study of Magerl et al.. Although several classifications were proposed, Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) were introduced in 2005. , This classification is based on the morphology of the injury, the status of the posterior longtidunal ligament (PLL) and neurologic examination. The energy that is generated due to axial and flexional loading in burst fractures is transmitted to the corpus and forces the corpus, which leads to some changes. , Burst fractures are classified according to the pathomorphological changes based on their radiological appearance. , The aim of this study is to create a simpler radiological classification in the burst fractures and to present their relation to secondary injuries. , Materials and Methods , After the approval was obtained from the ethics board of our hospital, the tomographic images and medical charts of 80 patients who were diagnosed with burst fractures were examined. , The patients were evaluated concerning age, sex, fracture segment, neurological deficit, secondary organ injury and radiological changes that occurred. , The classification was made according to the changes on the tomographic images as an indicator of the energy that was exposed. Neurological status was classified according to the ASIA scoring system. Secondary organ injury was assessed. , Secondary organ injury was evaluated in the light of the abdominal CT reports and abdominal USG reports. Rib fractures, lung contusions, haemothorax, pneumothorax, liver and spleen injuries were determined. , Radiological changes were assessed and classified according to the axial sections on CT. , Group 1: Fractures extend forward or laterally from the corpus. In general, a piece of the bone fragment may move to the spinal canal. The width of this spur usually depends on the distance between the radix of the pedicles (Because the pedicles are an obstacle before the bone fragment broken and detached from the corpus). , Different bone fragments can be protruded if the energy that is exposed also contains rotational motion in addition to the flexion and axial loading. PLL and spinal cord are the breaking points where some bone fragments stop moving and also leap or move backwards due to the effect of the moment’s dynamism. Consequently, some bone fragments can be seen in front of the corpus or/and near the corpus. , Usually, one piece of bone fragment moves on to the spinal canal. The protruded bone fragment may get closer to the PLC. Interpedicular distance is constant. , Group 2: There may be bone fragments in front of the corpus or/and near the corpus. There are some bone fragments that come closer to the PLC, but they don’t lead to the separation and splitting of the posterior components and don’t move into the spinal canal. Interpedicular distance is constant. , Group 3: There can be fractures in front of the corpus and at the sides of the corpus. There are bone fragments in the spinal canal. There are fractures on the lamina and spinous process. Interpedicular distance is extended. , PLC is used as a reference point while classifying the burst fractures. If the bone fragments can’t reach the PLC, it should be classified as Group 1. The fracture should be classified as Group 2 if it reaches the PLC and splits into pieces by crushing the corner. The fracture should be classified as Group 3 if it passes through the PLC and breaks the posterior components. The staging of burst fractures is shown in (Figure 1). , a) Grade 1) The bone fragments can’t reach the PLC; b) Grade 2) The fracture reaches the PLC and splits into pieces by crushing the corner; c) Grade 3) The fracture passes through the PLC and breaks the posterior components , Results , There were 27 female and 53 male patients in the group diagnosed with burst fractures. The mean age of the patients was 49.3. The mean age of the male patients was 49.4 (16 - 84) while it was 49.2 (20 - 72) for the female patients. , Five of the cases were observed in the thoracic region (6.2%), 17 at T12 (21%), 2 at both T12 and L1 (2.5%), 35 at L1 (43.7%) and 21 at lumbar region (26.2%) (Table 1). , Distribution of cases according to the region , Region\tNumber of Cases\t \tThoracic\t5 (6.2%)\t \tT12\t17 (21%)'»\n","[2] «page_content='number of patients, with the rates in parentheses. , This is the number of patients with another fragility fracture diagnosis code at a different anatomic location from the index fracture on a claim within 2 years of the index fracture. , Total Primary Fragility Fractures by Anatomic Location , Primary Fracture Location\tNo. of Fractures* (N = 36,295)\t \tSpine\t14,209 (39%)\t \tHip\t9,370 (26%)\t \tWrist\t4,897 (13%)\t \tHumerus\t4,277 (12%)\t \tPelvis\t2,943 (8%)\t \tOther pathologic fracture\t599 (2%)\t \t , The values are given as the number of fractures, with the percentage in parentheses.

Fracture reduction was considered adequate if angulation was <10°, rotation was <10°, and cortical displacement was <2 mm. , We recorded the operating surgeons’ status and divided them accordingly: junior resident, senior orthopaedic resident, senior hand surgery resident, orthopaedic consultant, and hand surgery consultant. Junior residents had <3 years of surgical experience, whereas senior residents had ≥3 years of experience, especially in the particular specialty.

Burst fractures take place in group A in AO classification. Fractures passing through the pedicles were added to the classification, but interpedicular separation and bone fragments with the excess pediculolaminar junction (corner) (PLC) in the spinal canal were not included in the study of Magerl et al.. Although several classifications were proposed, Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) were introduced in 2005. , This classification is based on the morphology of the injury, the status of the posterior longtidunal ligament (PLL) and neurologic examination. The energy that is generated due to axial and flexional loading in burst fractures is transmitted to the corpus and forces the corpus, which leads to some changes. , Burst fractures are classified according to the pathomorphological changes based on their radiological appearance. , The aim of this study is to create a simpler radiological classification in the burst fractures and to present their relation to secondary injuries. , Materials and Methods , After the approval was obtained from the ethics board of our hospital, the tomographic images and medical charts of 80 patients who were diagnosed with burst fractures were examined. , The patients were evaluated concerning age, sex, fracture segment, neurological deficit, secondary organ injury and radiological changes that occurred. , The classification was made according to the changes on the tomographic images as an indicator of the energy that was exposed. Neurological status was classified according to the ASIA scoring system. Secondary organ injury was assessed. , Secondary organ injury was evaluated in the light of the abdominal CT reports and abdominal USG reports. Rib fractures, lung contusions, haemothorax, pneumothorax, liver and spleen injuries were determined. , Radiological changes were assessed and classified according to the axial sections on CT. , Group 1: Fractures extend forward or laterally from the corpus. In general, a piece of the bone fragment may move to the spinal canal. The width of this spur usually depends on the distance between the radix of the pedicles (Because the pedicles are an obstacle before the bone fragment broken and detached from the corpus). , Different bone fragments can be protruded if the energy that is exposed also contains rotational motion in addition to the flexion and axial loading. PLL and spinal cord are the breaking points where some bone fragments stop moving and also leap or move backwards due to the effect of the moment’s dynamism. Consequently, some bone fragments can be seen in front of the corpus or/and near the corpus. , Usually, one piece of bone fragment moves on to the spinal canal. The protruded bone fragment may get closer to the PLC. Interpedicular distance is constant. , Group 2: There may be bone fragments in front of the corpus or/and near the corpus. There are some bone fragments that come closer to the PLC, but they don’t lead to the separation and splitting of the posterior components and don’t move into the spinal canal. Interpedicular distance is constant. , Group 3: There can be fractures in front of the corpus and at the sides of the corpus. There are bone fragments in the spinal canal. There are fractures on the lamina and spinous process. Interpedicular distance is extended. , PLC is used as a reference point while classifying the burst fractures. If the bone fragments can’t reach the PLC, it should be classified as Group 1. The fracture should be classified as Group 2 if it reaches the PLC and splits into pieces by crushing the corner. The fracture should be classified as Group 3 if it passes through the PLC and breaks the posterior components. The staging of burst fractures is shown in (Figure 1). , a) Grade 1) The bone fragments can’t reach the PLC; b) Grade 2) The fracture reaches the PLC and splits into pieces by crushing the corner; c) Grade 3) The fracture passes through the PLC and breaks the posterior components , Results , There were 27 female and 53 male patients in the group diagnosed with burst fractures. The mean age of the patients was 49.3. The mean age of the male patients was 49.4 (16 - 84) while it was 49.2 (20 - 72) for the female patients. , Five of the cases were observed in the thoracic region (6.2%), 17 at T12 (21%), 2 at both T12 and L1 (2.5%), 35 at L1 (43.7%) and 21 at lumbar region (26.2%) (Table 1). , Distribution of cases according to the region , Region\tNumber of Cases\t \tThoracic\t5 (6.2%)\t \tT12\t17 (21%)'»\n","[3] «page_content='number of patients, with the rates in parentheses. , This is the number of patients with another fragility fracture diagnosis code at a different anatomic location from the index fracture on a claim within 2 years of the index fracture. , Total Primary Fragility Fractures by Anatomic Location , Primary Fracture Location\tNo. of Fractures* (N = 36,295)\t \tSpine\t14,209 (39%)\t \tHip\t9,370 (26%)\t \tWrist\t4,897 (13%)\t \tHumerus\t4,277 (12%)\t \tPelvis\t2,943 (8%)\t \tOther pathologic fracture\t599 (2%)\t \t , The values are given as the number of fractures, with the percentage in parentheses.
